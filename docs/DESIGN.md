## 1. Problem and goals

Photos taken in the dark are underexposed, noisy and colour-shifted. Naive brightening (gamma, histogram equalisation) amplifies noise, blows out light sources, creates halos and shifts colours. We want a system that **estimates the illumination, adapts to each image, suppresses noise, restores colour and keeps edges and texture**, and that a person can **trust and understand**.

**Goals**
1. Output that is visibly and measurably better than classical-only and DL-only approaches on unseen images (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE).
2. Adaptive: no fixed enhancement strength; everything derived from measured image properties.
3. Runs on a plain CPU in seconds (deployed on a free 2-vCPU host; must answer within about 10 s).
4. Human-centred: explains itself, sets honest expectations, keeps the user in control, never invents content.

**Non-goals:** RAW-domain processing, video, generative "hallucinated" detail.

## 2. Users and human-centred design

| Persona | Need | How the design answers it |
|---|---|---|
| Phone user with a dim indoor or night photo | "Make it look good, quickly, from my phone" | One-tap enhance, camera capture, results in ~1–3 s, before/after slider, PNG download |
| Person with low vision | "Show me what's actually there" | *Maximum visibility* preset; text explanations; high-contrast UI; colour-blind-safe heatmaps |
| Field / inspection worker documenting dim spaces | "Don't make things up" | Curve-based brightening (pixel-wise, monotone) plus a residual-only restorer; a *recoverability* rating says when detail cannot be trusted |
| Curious user / judge | "Why does it look like that?" | *What we noticed / What we did* in plain language; every intermediate map in *Under the hood*; *Compare methods* tab |

**Design principles:** explain, don't just output · honest uncertainty (recoverability rating, blown-out / residual-grain warnings) · user agency (intent presets, brightness slider; *Auto* recommended, never forced) · privacy by default (in-memory processing, temp files purged within an hour, nothing logged) · accessibility (mobile layout, large targets, text alternatives for every visual, cividis colour maps).

**Interface states:** empty (prompt plus examples) · loading (Gradio progress on every output) · success (slider, summary, diagnosis, actions, quality table) · warning (inline ⚠️ lines) · error (friendly `gr.Error` messages for: no image, non-image, < 32 px, processing failure; never a stack trace). Photos keep their size up to 2048 px (enhanced at ≤ 1280 px, then returned full size with detail transfer, §5.6); anything resized is stated with both sizes.

## 4. Data

| Set | Use | Size |
|---|---|---|
| LOL-v1 `our485` | **train 435 / validation 50**, seeded split (`results/split.json`) | 485 pairs, 600×400 |
| LOL-v1 `eval15` | test (paired) | 15 |
| LOL-v2 real `Test` | test, **clean subset only** (paired) | 9 of 100 (see below) |
| LOL-v2 synthetic `Test` | test, synthetic darkening of RAISE photos (paired) | 100 |
| ExDark (384 px release) | test, real-world night photos, **no reference** (letterbox trimmed) | 60 sampled (seed 0) |

**Leakage found and fixed (2026-11-07).** LOL-v2 real re-packages LOL-v1: a pixel-hash check showed that 86 of its 100 test *inputs* and 91 of its 100 *references* are identical to LOL-v1 `our485` images, which are our training/validation data. Our earlier LOL-v2-real numbers (and the robustness sweep, built from those references) were therefore partly measured on training images. `scripts/evaluate.py` now hashes every `our485` image and keeps only LOL-v2 real pairs whose input **and** reference are absent (9 pairs, 3 scenes); the robustness sweep now uses LOL-v2 *synthetic* references, and the ablation runs on eval15 + LOL-v2 synthetic. eval15, LOL-v2 synthetic and ExDark share no image with `our485`. The test sets are never read by `train_dce.py`, `train_restore.py`, or when choosing any constant; checkpoint selection and every constant of the quality-aware update were decided on the 50-image validation split (and a compressed version of it, §5.6).

## 5. Method

### 5.1 Classical stages
- **Illumination T:** max(R,G,B) (Retinex/LIME prior: reflectance ≤ 1), refined with a **guided filter** in √-space (radius 1.5% of image size) so T is smooth within regions but follows object edges. This is why Retinex brightening produces no halos at lamp/wall boundaries.
- **Retinex re-lighting:** output = I · min(T^(γ−1), 25). γ is solved per image by bisection on a 256-px thumbnail so mean brightness hits the adaptive target. The 25× cap exists because beyond it an 8-bit input holds only quantisation/JPEG noise; we found this cause of "confetti" artefacts in near-black regions during development.
- **CLAHE** on Lab lightness in 16-bit (no banding), blended at an adaptive weight.
- **Denoising (classical path):** two bilateral passes on luma (range σ tied to the measured noise), chroma smoothed by a guided filter steered by the clean luma. The bilateral pair beat a single pass, a guided-only variant and OpenCV NLM on the LOL **training** split (PSNR 16.24 vs 16.07 / 16.11 / 16.10).
- **Colour:** partial gray-world white balance (strength from measured cast, reduced 70% when coloured light sources are detected) + saturation compensation; **soft-knee highlight roll-off** instead of clipping.

### 5.2 Deep-learning stages
- **Zero-DCE++** (re-implemented in `dce.py`, official weights loaded and verified): 10,561 parameters; predicts a per-pixel curve map applied 8×. **Fine-tuned** on our LOL train split with L1 + 0.3·(1−SSIM) + Zero-DCE's illumination-smoothness (TV) and colour-constancy terms as regularisers. Adam 3e-4, cosine schedule, 256-px crops, flips. Validation PSNR 14.32 → 16.81 dB. Stopped at epoch 8 after the plateau (≤0.05 dB change over 5 epochs).
- **Restoration U-Net** (`restore.py`, ours): 3 scales (16/32/64 channels), residual output, 144,579 parameters. Input = hybrid front-end output + 1-channel **noise-level map**. Trained 4000 iterations, batch 16, 128-px crops, OneCycle LR 1e-3, L1 + 0.2·(1−SSIM). Training inputs are produced by the exact inference code (`pipeline.prepare`), so there is no train/test mismatch.
  - **Training data = 435 real LOL pairs + 435 synthetic pairs.** Each synthetic pair degrades one LOL *training* reference physically: exposure ×0.02–×0.5 in linear light (log-uniform), Poisson shot noise and Gaussian read noise. Real LOL pairs only cover LOL's own noise range. Without the synthetic pairs, the network stopped denoising once the noise map went beyond it: on validation references darkened ×0.025, the restorer output was 15.8 dB while plain classical denoising reached 19.6. Checkpoints are selected on the mean of real and synthetic **validation** PSNR (50 + 50 held-out images).
- **Quality-aware strategy:** (a) the DL curve strength is chosen from 20 candidates (×0.1–×2.0) by a no-reference quality score (|brightness − target| + 2 × newly clipped fraction); (b) fusion weights are per-pixel quality scores; (c) the restorer is conditioned on the measured noise.

### 5.3 Hybrid integration
1. Classical T + diagnosis → adaptive parameters.
2. Retinex candidate and fine-tuned Zero-DCE++ candidate.
3. **Per-pixel fusion** by Mertens-style quality (well-exposedness × blurred-Laplacian contrast) **÷ amplification** (1 + (gain/12)²). This prefers the candidate that needed less gain, which suppresses noise amplification. Blended with a 5-level **Laplacian pyramid** (seamless, no halos).
4. Highlight guard → adaptive CLAHE → colour correction.
5. **Noise map** = noise σ measured on the brightened image (all channels) × relative local gain, derived from the illumination model. It is fed to the restoration U-Net, which removes noise where it was amplified and keeps texture elsewhere.
6. User intent (preset × slider) applied last as an exposure adjustment, so the restorer always sees its training distribution.

### 5.4 Adaptive parameter rules (`analysis.choose_params`)

| Parameter | Rule (monotone interpolation of a measured property) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Target brightness | 0.42 (LOL train GT mean = 0.456) × intent × interp(lighting spread 4→7 stops, 1→0.75) | night scenes with lamps should stay night-like |
| Retinex γ | bisection to reach target | per-image exposure |
| DCE curve strength | argmin of quality score over 0.5…2.0 | quality-aware |
| CLAHE clip | interp(contrast 0.3→1.2, 2.5→1.2) | low-contrast images get more |
| CLAHE weight | interp(expected noise 4→30, 0.6→0.15) | don't boost grain |
| White balance | interp(cast 3→15, 0→0.8) × (0.3 if coloured lights) | keep neon / sodium colours |
| Saturation | interp(brightness 0.02→0.25, 1.15→1.0) | darker images lose more chroma |
| Detail β (classical) | interp(expected noise 3→25, 1.15→0.85) | sharpen clean images only |
| Denoise strength | 90th percentile of the noise map | measured, not guessed |

### 5.6 Image-quality-aware adaptive enhancement (added 2026-11-07)

Two user photos exposed what a brightness-only strategy misses: a small, compressed flower photo came out **pixelated and oversaturated**, and a large, clean living-room photo came out **soft**. Diagnosis (measured, not guessed):
- *Flower:* Retinex divides by max(R,G,B), so in near-black pixels the chroma *noise* becomes saturated colour (input chroma 4.7 → 36.7); the darkness-based saturation boost (×1.13) and CLAHE added more; and an 11–21× gain on a 300-px JPEG turned invisible 8×8 blocks into visible ones.
- *Living room:* the restoration U-Net removes fine texture along with noise (sharpness index 0.050 → 0.021) and nothing put it back; and the engine returned 1280 px for a 3872 px photo, which the browser then upscaled.

The pipeline now measures image quality first and picks operations from it (`analysis.strategy`, shown to the user as the *Enhancement breakdown*):

| Measured | How | Decides |
|---|---|---|
| Illumination level + non-uniformity | mean luma, p90−p10 of log₂ T | target, gain |
| Noise | Immerkær σ on the input and **after brightening** (noise map); residual σ after restoration | pre-denoise, restoration conditioning, sharpening strength |
| Sharpness / blur | exposure-normalised Laplacian energy (σ-1 pre-blur so grain counts little), measured **after** noise removal | detail-recovery strength (none if already sharp) |
| Edge strength | p90 gradient of normalised luma | reported |
| Colour | Lab chroma ÷ lightness (colourfulness), mean-colour cast | white balance; saturation ceiling (classical path) |
| Compression | 8×8 grid step energy vs elsewhere, best of 8 offsets (blockiness) | boundary deblocking, gentler CLAHE, no fine sharpening |
| Resolution / recoverable detail | size; recoverability rating | gain cap (14× instead of 25× when < 400 px or blocky), detail trust |

New operations, all gated by those measurements:
1. **Denoise before brightening** (`classical.pre_denoise`; the noise-level map is still measured on the original photo as well, so the restorer is not told that the noise pre-denoising hid is gone): luma-guided chroma smoothing, plus JPEG deblocking of luma **only at the 8×8 block boundaries** (the grid offset is detected), so in-block texture survives. In the hybrid this runs only for blocky JPEGs: on validation, pre-denoising clean-but-noisy PNGs before the restoration network lowered SSIM (0.824 → 0.812), because the network was trained on raw sensor noise.
2. **Saturation ceiling, classical path only** (`classical.limit_saturation`): chroma is scaled down (hue kept) only if mid-tone colourfulness, measured *after* denoising, exceeds 0.55 (LOL references: p90 0.39). The hybrid first had this ceiling *before* its restoration network; there chroma noise inflates colourfulness (0.64 on a clean LOL-v2 input whose reference is 0.17), so it fired on noise and dulled true colours. It was removed from the hybrid after a re-validation on fresh data (eval file §9.6); the hybrid's colour noise is handled by pre-brightening chroma denoising (JPEGs) and by the restoration network.
3. **Adaptive detail recovery after noise removal** (`classical.recover_detail`): (a) detail the restorer removed is re-injected only where it exceeds the *local* noise of the pre-restoration image (coring at 2.5σ of the noise map, so grain never comes back); (b) two-scale unsharp masking against Gaussian blurs (σ 1 and 3) cored at the residual noise; (c) a halo clamp (3×3 local min/max ± 0.04). The first version used an edge-preserving guided-filter base; a source audit found that this keeps edges in the base, so the stage changed blurred inputs by only 0.07 grey levels on average. The Gaussian base at 0.3 / 0.15 strength was then chosen on validation (eval file §9.8). Strengths fall with residual noise, already-high sharpness, low recoverability, and fine sharpening is off for blocky JPEGs.
4. **Resolution preservation** (`pipeline.run_full`): photos are enhanced at ≤ 1280 px (CPU budget) and returned at their own size (≤ 2048 px; larger photos are reduced first and the UI says so). The missing fine band is taken from the photo itself: (input − its own low-pass) × local brightening gain, cored at a robust per-tile noise estimate, and used only in tiles where the band is heavy-tailed like real structure (RMS/robust σ ≥ 1.3–1.8) rather than Gaussian-like noise. Nothing is invented: every added detail is in the input and above its noise.
5. **Auto mode** chooses Classical, DL or Hybrid per photo from no-reference checks (exposure, residual noise, clipping, colour cast + oversaturation, detail, blockiness), with the formula shown in the app.

Cases A–E from the brief map to: extremely dark → gain cap + strong restoration, little sharpening (noise-limited); brightened but blurry → detail recovery at full strength (clean, soft); dark and noisy → denoise first, sharpening scaled down by residual noise; uneven illumination → Retinex per-pixel gain + target reduction for high lighting spread; already well lit → minimal gain, sharpening off if sharp.

Validation evidence (never the test sets): our485 validation split (50 pairs) and a compressed proxy of it (384 px, JPEG q70, standing in for small real-world JPEGs). Key decisions: re-injection must be cored at the reference's own noise (otherwise it re-injected grain); deblocking must be boundary-only (full-image deblocking removed blocks but erased texture: detail 0.69× the reference, LPIPS 0.270 → 0.310); CLAHE stays at 40 % on deblocked JPEGs (full CLAHE: −0.8 dB); full-size transfer must be structure-gated (ungated, it added noise speckle on smooth surfaces).

### 5.7 Alternatives tried and rejected
- **Illumination-guided Zero-DCE++** (T as a 4th input channel, zero-initialised): after 4 epochs it was indistinguishable from plain Zero-DCE++ (same validation PSNR to 0.01 dB, 4th-channel weights ≈ 0.003). A curve-only network cannot denoise, and noise was the bottleneck, so the integration effort moved to the noise-map-conditioned restoration stage.
- **Uncapped Retinex gain:** produced coloured "confetti" in near-black JPEG regions (160× gain). Replaced by the 25× cap plus the amplification-aware fusion.
- **Input-domain noise estimate for the map:** under-estimates noise in 8-bit/JPEG dark images (e.g. σ = 0.6 on a visibly grainy ExDark photo). Replaced by measuring on the brightened image.
- **NLM denoising (classical path):** slower and no better than two bilateral passes on the training split.
- **Curve-strength grid ×0.5–×2.0:** moderately dark inputs always picked the lower bound (×0.5) and were still over-brightened. A search pinned to its boundary means the range was too narrow, so it was widened to ×0.1–×2.0.
- **"Exposure lock"** (forcing the restorer to keep the input's mean brightness): it helped on LOL-v2-derived data, whose references are darker (mean luma 0.371) than LOL's (0.453 test, 0.456 train). On our **validation** split it *cost* 0.6 dB, so we rejected it. Its apparent benefit was a dataset brightness convention, not robustness. (How we found this: a test-time robustness sweep exposed a weakness; every candidate fix was then decided on the validation split only, so test data never selected a design.)

## 6. Evaluation methodology
- **Paired sets:** PSNR, SSIM (Gaussian 11×11, σ=1.5, RGB), LPIPS (AlexNet, pyiqa), NIQE (pyiqa), residual noise σ (Immerkær), edge preservation index (Laplacian correlation with ground truth), CIEDE2000 colour shift, newly over-exposed pixel %, brightness error.
- **Unpaired (ExDark):** NIQE, residual noise, clipping, colour cast, brightness.
- **Robustness:** 30 unseen LOL-v2-synthetic references degraded physically (linear light × k, Poisson shot noise at 800 e⁻ full-well, Gaussian read noise 0.002, sRGB re-encode, 8-bit) at k ∈ {0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025} plus a strongly non-uniform spotlight.
- **Latency:** sequential single process, after warm-up, mean of 6 LOL images (600×400), 3 runs at 1280×960 and 2 runs of a 2048×1536 upload returned at full size, laptop CPU (no GPU).
- **Ablation:** hybrid with one component removed, on LOL-v1 eval15 + LOL-v2 synthetic (the clean LOL-v2 real subset is too small for stable differences); the before/after comparison of the quality-aware update also runs on ExDark.
- **Auto mode:** the per-image recommendation, scored with the ground truth it never sees, against always-hybrid and an oracle.

Results, ablation and failure analysis: **[`eval_P1_T76.md`](../eval_P1_T76.md)**. Headline (clean test sets, hybrid): 18.19 dB / 0.769 SSIM / 0.249 LPIPS / 4.25 NIQE averaged over 124 unseen pairs (best of six methods on 7 of 8 metrics); lowest residual noise on ExDark; best in all six conditions of the darkness sweep. The quality-aware update is neutral on the LOL-style sets after removing the hybrid's saturation ceiling (a fix prompted by a test result and chosen on fresh validation data, eval file §9.5–9.6); ExDark NIQE 4.18 → 4.62 with it. A final source audit (eval file §9.8) replaced the sharpening base and the noise read, both chosen on validation (`scripts/validate.py`, `results/validation/`).

**Model selection (validation only).** Restorer v2 (LOL pairs only) vs v3 (LOL + synthetic pairs), full pipeline, 50 held-out real pairs + their synthetic degradations: v2 19.65 / 17.54 dB (real / synthetic), v3 19.41 / 19.90 dB. **v3 selected**: −0.24 dB on real, +2.36 dB on synthetic, real/synthetic gap 0.49 vs 2.11 dB. On the test sets (seen only afterwards) v3 gained on LOL-v1 (+0.62 dB) and extreme darkness; its LOL-v2 real comparison was on the contaminated 100-pair set and is withdrawn.

**Noise-map conditioning, honestly:** it helps on real captures (+0.25 dB v2, +0.20 dB v3 on validation), hurts on synthetic noise (−1.48 / −0.21 dB), and is a tie overall for v3 (19.65 vs 19.66). It is a small, real-data-specific benefit.

## 7. Deployment and reproducibility
- `docker build -t lumina . && docker run -p 7860:7860 lumina`, or `pip install -r requirements.txt torch && python app.py`.
- Primary interface: the LUMINA web app (team's LUMORA v4 design) on Vercel, calling the engine's JSON API (`api.py`) cross-origin; details in [`FRONTEND.md`](FRONTEND.md).
- Engine hosted on a Hugging Face Space (Gradio SDK, free ZeroGPU hardware, CPU inference), which also serves the classic Gradio interface as a fallback. The Dockerfile is for self-hosting and was **not built in our environment** (no Docker available); the pip + `python app.py` route is the tested one.
- Reproduce everything: `python scripts/download_data.py && python scripts/train_dce.py && python scripts/train_restore.py && python scripts/train_restore.py --no-map && python scripts/evaluate.py && python scripts/report.py`. Seeds are fixed, and the split is saved in `results/split.json`.
- Tests: `python -m pytest -q` (filter properties, gamma solver, every method and ablation, tiny/flat/extreme inputs).
- No secrets anywhere: the app needs no API keys.

## 8. Limitations
See also *About* in the app. In short: (1) no method recovers detail below the noise floor, and near-black regions stay soft; (2) coloured lighting vs colour cast is ambiguous; (3) already-clipped highlights can't be recovered; (4) the restorer was trained on LOL (indoor, one sensor family) plus synthetic sensor noise; compressed/correlated noise (video frames, heavy JPEG) is outside its training distribution; (5) heavy JPEG blocking is amplified; (6) PSNR and SSIM reward matching a dataset's exposure convention (our three worst LOL-v2 cases gain ~9 dB from one global brightness gain), which isn't necessarily what a user wants (hence presets); (7) highlight protection runs before the restorer, which can re-clip highlights; the ablation shows it has no measurable effect, so overexposure (1.11 % new clipped pixels on average) is our weakest metric; (8) colour decisions must be measured on denoised images: the first version of the update capped saturation before the hybrid's restorer and lost 0.27 / 0.76 dB on eval15 / clean LOL-v2 real; it was removed from the hybrid after re-validation on fresh data (eval file §9.6); (9) per-photo Auto selection from no-reference checks does not beat always-hybrid on validation, so Auto keeps the hybrid unless another output is clearly better; (10) detail lost below the noise floor is not recovered (by design: nothing is invented).

## 9. Ethics and responsible use
- **No hallucination by design:** brightening is pixel-wise and monotone; restoration is a residual correction conditioned on measured noise, with no generative prior.
- **Not for evidence or identification:** stated in the app. Enhancement changes pixel values; faces and plates may *look* clearer without being more reliable.
- **Privacy:** no storage or logging; temp files are purged automatically.
- **Dataset licences:** LOL, LOL-v2 and ExDark are research datasets, used for research/education only; example images are attributed in `examples/SOURCES.md`.
- **Accessibility and inclusion:** mobile-first, colour-blind-safe visuals, plain-language explanations.

## 11. Future work
Fine-tune the restorer on more diverse real data (e.g. SID sRGB, phone captures, compressed video frames) so detail survives restoration in the first place; a learned recoverability/uncertainty map; tiled processing beyond 2048 px; on-device (ONNX/TFLite) export. Together the two networks are about 155k parameters, which makes on-device use realistic.
